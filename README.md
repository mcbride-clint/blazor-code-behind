# blazor-code-behind
Basic New Item Template for Creating a Razor Component with a .cs Code Behind Page.

Visual Studio "Add New Item" Template is working correctly.  .Net CLI template works but it does not allow you to name the file at Creation.

Includes a .vsix Extension for adding the Template to Visual Studio.
